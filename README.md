This project is a web application for managing campgrounds, inspired by "Yelp for Campgrounds," which lets users view, create, edit, and delete campground listings.
The main technologies used include Node.js with Express for server-side handling, MongoDB for data storage, and EJS for templating and rendering views.
The app follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure, making it organized and maintainable.
